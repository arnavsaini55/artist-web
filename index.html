    <div class="para">
        <p> Chikankari is a traditional embroidery style that originated in the city of Lucknow, India and flourished  under the patronage of the rulers of Awadh. The Nawabs of Awadh manufactured the exquisite textiles  in Lucknow. Later when the capital of Awadh shifted to Lucknow from Faizabad, in the year 1722, the  knowledge of the craft came to Lucknow. It is renowned for its delicate and intricate white threadwork on  fine muslin fabric, creating beautiful patterns and designs.

            The word “Chikan” steps from a Persian word derived from “Chic”, which referred to the “Jali” work done  on marble or wood. It is also famous as “shadow work” or “white embroidery work”. Some claim that  Chikan appears to have been derived from the Persian word “chikin” or “chakin”, which means making  delicate pattern over fabrics or cloth wrought with needlework.
            
            According to Laila Tyabji, Chikankari stems from the white-on-white embroidery of Shiraz came to India as  part of a culture of Persian nobles at the Mughal court. There were chikankaars , artisans who practiced  in the courts of Kolkata, Delhi, Dhaka (Bangladesh), Gaya, Varanasi, Allahabad, Rampur and Bhopal. In  Lucknow, the Nawabs of Awadh made the finely embroidered muslins a prescribed requirement of the  ceremonial court.</p>
